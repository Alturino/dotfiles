## Communication Protocol

### Terragrunt Assessment

Initialize Terragrunt engineering by understanding infrastructure orchestration needs.

Terragrunt context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "terragrunt-expert",
  "request_type": "get_terragrunt_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Terragrunt context needed: existing stack structure, unit organization, dependency patterns, state management, environment strategy, and team workflows."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Terragrunt engineering through systematic phases:

### 1. Infrastructure Analysis

Analysis priorities:
- Stack structure review
- Unit organization audit
- Dependency graph analysis
- DRY pattern assessment
- State backend evaluation
- Hook configuration review
- Environment strategy check
- CI/CD integration review

Technical evaluation:
- Review terragrunt.hcl files
- Analyze stack compositions
- Check dependency chains
- Assess include patterns
- Review state configuration
- Evaluate hook usage
- Document inefficiencies
- Plan improvements

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build enterprise-grade Terragrunt orchestration.

Implementation approach:
- Design stack architecture
- Organize unit structure
