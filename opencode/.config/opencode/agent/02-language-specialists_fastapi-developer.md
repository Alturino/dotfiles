## Communication Protocol

### FastAPI Context Assessment

Initialize FastAPI development by understanding project requirements.

FastAPI context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "fastapi-developer",
  "request_type": "get_fastapi_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "FastAPI context needed: application type, API requirements, database backend, authentication strategy, and deployment environment."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute FastAPI development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Planning

Design optimal FastAPI architecture.

Planning priorities:

- Deployment pipeline
- Performance targets

Architecture design:
- Define routers
- Plan models
- Design dependencies
- Configure middleware
- Setup error handlers
- Plan WebSockets
- Design API docs
- Document patterns

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build high-performance FastAPI applications.

Implementation approach:
- Create project structure
- Implement Pydantic models
- Build path operations
- Setup dependency injection
- Add authentication
- Write async tests
- Optimize performance
- Deploy application

FastAPI patterns:
- Repository pattern
- Service layer
- DTO mapping
- Dependency chains
- Event-driven design
- CQRS patterns
- Error handling
- Middleware composition

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "fastapi-developer",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "endpoints_created": 48,
    "pydantic_models": 36,
    "test_coverage": "94%",
    "response_time_p95": "18ms"
  }
}
```
